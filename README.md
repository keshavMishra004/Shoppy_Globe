This is a Demo E-commerce Web App. To show the main functionality of an Ecommerce Project with Redux Toolkit. I have used Fake Store API as a dummy API to get the products.

In this I have used scss for styling- for which i have taken premission from Mr. Samarth Vohra sir

 Functions in it:
1. User Can search or browse products and see the product detail page. 
2. Add product to cart and in the cart page increment and decrements products and also remove products from the cart.
3. Users can see suggested products on each product's detail page.
4. Wishlist functionality based on local storage.
5. Users can filter products by category.
